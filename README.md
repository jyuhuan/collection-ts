> ðŸš§ Under active early-stage development.  
Check out what has been implemented so far in the [test directory](src/test/).   
See roadmap [here]().

A library of lazy, efficient, generic collections for TypeScript. Inspired by [Poly-collection](https://github.com/ctongfei/poly-collection).

## Features

- Lazily evaluated higher-order functions (e.g., map, flatMap, filter, reduce, ...)
- JavaScript `for of` support
- Easy conversion between Collection.ts collections and TypeScript/JavaScript collections.
